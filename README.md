# cse237-project

## Implemented stories:<br/>
  A player should be able to choose how many decks to play with.<br/>
  A player should be able to hit and stand.<br/>
  A player should be able to see the scores and hands of the dealer and player throughout a round at the appropriate times.<br/>
  A player should be notified if they won, lost, or pushed on a hand.<br/>
  A player should be able to choose to start a new hand.<br/>
  A dealer should be able to shuffle the deck.<br/>
  A dealer should be able to deal out cards.<br/>

## Stories to implement for Iteration 2:<br/>
  A player should be able to choose to start the game with a certain number of chips. <br/>
  A player should be able to bet on each hand and recieve winnings based on payout rules.<br/>
  A player should be able to double down on their hand.<br/>
  A player should be able to split their hand.<br/>
  A dealer should be able to complete their hand based on hitting rules for the dealer.<br/>
  
## Features that don't work:<br/>
  The double down, split buttons on the GUI are currently placeholders that do nothing.<br/>
  The bet and chip totals do not update based on bets placed on a hand. <br/>
  An ace is only treated as having a value of 11, but it should alsobe able to be scored as a 1. <br/>
  Every game goes through the same sequence of cards delt. <br/>

## Command to launch the game:<br/>
